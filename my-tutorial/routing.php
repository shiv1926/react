    <li>In web development a routing is a HTTP request, which decides what should happen when a user visit a page.</li>
    <li>In server side rendering whenever we click on any link their corresponding page get load.</li>
    <li>In layman's terms, consider a building which has four rooms. One has a doctor, the second an engineer, the third a lawyer and in the last one, a teacher. There is a person outside these rooms, sitting at a desk. When a customer arrives , let us assume he asks for the doctor. Then the person at the desk handles this request by taking him to room A where the doctor is. If a customer comes looking for an engineer, the desk person takes him to room B. And so on.</li>
    <li>Similarly, when a HTTP request is made to the server, the router determines how to handle that request. The HTTP request method can be GET/POST so on.</li>
    <li>Many modern websites are actually made up of a single page, they just look like multiple pages because they contain components which render like separate pages. These are usually referred to as SPAs - single-page applications. At its core, what React Router does is conditionally render certain components to display depending on the route being used in the URL (/ for the home page, /about for the about page, etc.).</li>
